Ant Colony Algorithm for finding Shortest Path (Multi-Robot Environment)

This project and code repository aims at helping robots evaluate shortest path to destination avoiding obstacles mimicking 
the behaviour of Ants. The way how Ants keep track of pheromone trails left by other ants and follow the path where the
trail strength is more.

This is the simulation of ant behaviour in Java and it's being currently worked on implemnting this on real robots which is challenging.
